Variable Objects
================

This is an implementation of couple of [Ryan
Hipple](https://twitter.com/roboryantron)'s [scriptable
objects](https://youtu.be/raQ3iHhE_Kk). Note that he is not affiliated with
this project.

After playing around with a basic implementation, I really liked how Hipple's
Variable Object system worked. However, this early implementation relied on
Bash scripts to automate certain editor tasks... not the best solution!

So I spent a couple months refining the editor tools for this. I think the
project is at a point where I'm happy to share it with the world. Most of this
work isn't on the original scriptable objects, but on the Unity Editor tools.

Installation
------------
IMPORTANT: You also need the [EventObjects package](https://github.com/ReachBeyond/EventObjects)!

Go to *Projects*, and grab the latest unitypackage. Extract this into your
project, and you're done! Alternatively, you can also clone/submodule this into
your current project using git. If you do that, I recommend putting it under a
path such as Imported/ReachBeyond/plugins/VariableObjects.

In the future, I'd like to get this Unity's Asset Store. I'll put a link here
once that becomes a reality.

Usage
-----
I recommend you watch the video linked above. It explains the gist of this
project.

Variable objects allow you to track values outside of specific components. In
this sense, they are global. However, they give the Unity Editor control over
what objects can access these components.

I won't describe these in much detail for the time being. I highly recommend
watching the video linked above for the premise. I'll mostly be going over what
I've added.

Variable Objects inherit from Event Objects. Whenever the value of a Variable
Object changes, it emits an event. This lets you create Listeners that trigger
when a value gets updated.


There are components called **Registraters**. These allow you to make
'singletons' using variable objects. They're ideal for prefabs that you only
want to exist one time in the scene, such as a player, a boss, or HUD elements.

In the future, I want to create a variation of this which works with lists,
making objects automatically add/remove themselves to/from a list. Also,
registraters only work with reference datatypes (i.e. classes).


If you go to the **Window** dropdown, you'll find a couple of buttons related
to Variable Objects. One will let you view/manage all of the variable object types
supported, while the other lets you create new ones.

You normally shouldn't need to create new variable objects unless you need to
keep track of variables using your own datatypes. (If you do use this feature,
make sure you read all the tooltips and hints. If you don't, you'll get syntax
errors.)

These editor tools require tags to work correctly. If you need to move files
around, make sure the tags are preserved!


Developer Notes
---------------
If the define symbol **REACHBEYOND\_VAROBJ\_BUILTIN\_MODE** is used,
then editor tools will do a couple of things:

* The VariableObject settings panel will allow you to edit/delete scripts
  associated with built in types.
* The wizard which generates the scripts will generate templates that will
  be treated as built in types.

To change the scripting define symbols, refer to this page:
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PlayerSettingsStandalone.html#Configuration


Other Things
------------
More documentation will come eventually.
